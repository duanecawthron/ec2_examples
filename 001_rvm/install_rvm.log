Notes for Linux ( Amazon Linux AMI release 2011.02.1.1 (beta) )

NOTE: 'ruby' represents Matz's Ruby Interpreter (MRI) (1.8.X, 1.9.X)
             This is the *original* / standard Ruby Language Interpreter
      'ree'  represents Ruby Enterprise Edition
      'rbx'  represents Rubinius

bash >= 3.2 is required
curl is required
git is required (>= 1.7 recommended)
patch is required (for ree and some ruby-head's).

If you wish to install rbx and/or Ruby 1.9 head (MRI) (eg. 1.9.2-head),
then you must install and use rvm 1.8.7 first.

If you wish to have the 'pretty colors' again,
  set 'export rvm_pretty_print_flag=1' in ~/.rvmrc.

dependencies:
  # For RVM
  rvm: yum install -y bash curl git # NOTE: For git you need the EPEL repository enabled

  # For Ruby (MRI & Ree) you should install the following OS dependencies:
  ruby: yum install -y gcc-c++ patch readline readline-devel zlib zlib-devel libyaml-devel libffi-devel openssl-devel ;
        yum install -y make bzip2 ;
        yum install -y iconv-devel # NOTE: For centos 5.4 final iconv-devel might not be available :(

  # For JRuby (if you wish to use it) you will need:
  jruby: yum install -y java

For rbx (Rubinius) more than 600MB of free RAM required.


Installation of RVM to /usr/local/rvm/ is complete.


root,

Thank you very much for using RVM! I sincerely hope that RVM helps to
make your life both easier and more enjoyable.

If you have any questions, issues and/or ideas for improvement please
join#rvm on irc.freenode.net and let me know, note you must register
(http://bit.ly/5mGjlm) and identify (/msg nickserv <nick> <pass>) to
talk, this prevents spambots from ruining our day.

My irc nickname is 'wayneeseguin' and I hang out in #rvm typically

  ~09:00-17:00EDT and again from ~21:00EDT-~23:00EDT

If I do not respond right away, please hang around after asking your
question, I will respond as soon as I am back.  It is best to talk in
#rvm itself as then other users can help out should I be offline.

Be sure to get head often as rvm development happens fast,
you can do this by running 'rvm get head' followed by 'rvm reload'
or opening a new shell

  w⦿‿⦿t

    ~ Wayne
